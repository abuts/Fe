% 
% describes initial fit of range of cuts made from a single file in one direction

file:
TF_(SQW_source)_bragg_(Bragg ID e.g. [101])_dir_(cut direction id e.g. [100]).mat 

is the source file for cuts_le_processor class and contains the following information:

  data_source:  The full name of the sqw file where cut has been taken from. (e.g. 'd:\Users\abuts\Data\Fe\June2017\sqw\Data\Fe_ei200.sqw')
        bragg:  The index of the Bragg reflection of cuts containing in this file, also reflected in filename (e.g. [1 1 0])
cut_direction:  The hkl direction of the cut, also reflected in filename (e.g  [1 0 0])
           dE:  The energy half-width of a cut (e.g. 5)
           dK:  The wavevectir half-width of the cut (e.g. 0.0500)
     cut_list:  Array of cuts made from described parameters (e.g. [15×1 sqw])
   w1D_arr1_tf: Array of of fits made for these cuts obtained from Tobyfit (e.g. [15×1 sqw])
       fp_arr1: Fif parameters for the fits (i.e. [1×1 struct])
      es_valid: Energies of the cuts [15×1 double]
      
Fit parameters, containing in fp_arr1.p cell are:
%   par = [ff, T, gamma, Seff, gap, J0, J1, J2, 0, 0];
where:
ff     -- is magnetic form-factor applied
T      -- temperature
gamma  -- damping 
Seff   -- spin wave amplitude
gap    -- gap between spin-wave and 0 energy transfer plane
J0-J6  -- interaction energies for different coordination spheres interactions
      
Can be plotted by plot_dirCut procedure, accepting either the whole filename or parts of the cut information, containing 
within the file name
